# **Local Singles Date Night** 

© Copyright 2025 Joshua Marks all rights reserved. CONFIDENTIAL: Proprietary & Trade Secret

### **Executive Summary**

**Local Singles Date Night** is a dating platform that flips the traditional model on its head: instead of paying for memberships or endless boosts, users pre‑purchase a **1, 3, 5, or 10‑dinner package** from participating local restaurants and businesses. Once a user commits to a **time window** and a set of **acceptable experience types** (e.g., casual dinner, dessert & walk, activity \+ drink), the platform reveals compatible, nearby candidates who are also available for that slot and experience. This “availability‑first” approach reduces chat fatigue, accelerates real‑world meetings, and channels dating spend directly into neighborhood venues, creating a differentiated value proposition that is both **community‑minded** and **experience‑led**. 

The user journey is intentionally simple and safety‑forward. New members create a compact profile with **≤5 photos**, a short “what I’m looking for” blurb, interests, languages, and credentials, then **select local businesses** they want to support. The platform curates a menu of **first‑date prix‑fixe packages** in regions with sufficient user density; when a user commits to a time window, the system surfaces **suitable candidates** and enables a limited “Ask” action. If the invite is accepted, the app confirms the reservation, issues a **voucher/QR** to the venue, and opens chat—only after booking—to reduce harassment and no‑shows. Post‑date feedback flows improve matching quality, venue ratings, and future recommendations.

For merchants, Local Singles Date Night delivers **predictable prepaid revenue**, demand smoothing on lower‑traffic nights, and turnkey co‑marketing. Partners configure their **prix‑fixe menus**, capacity by time slot, and blackout dates through a lightweight portal; redemption is handled with a simple QR at the point of service. The platform monetizes via a **transparent 100% service fee** on top of the venue’s fixed price, aligning incentives around curated experiences, reliable bookings, and guest satisfaction. Over time, deeper integrations (POS APIs, inventory sync) and multi‑business bundles (e.g., dinner \+ mini‑golf) expand basket size while preserving operational control for local owners.

Growth is executed city‑by‑city with clear density thresholds before unlocking matching. Trust and safety are embedded—ID verification, image moderation, rate‑limited “Ask,” venue staff escalation paths, and fair recredit policies. Success metrics center on **completed first dates per active user**, **slot utilization**, **accept and show rates**, and **partner NPS**. By converting dating intent into prepaid, time‑bound experiences, Local Singles Date Night creates a **win‑win marketplace**: fewer unproductive swipes for singles, more guaranteed covers for local businesses, and a defensible, community‑rooted brand that scales.

### **Elevator Pitch**

**Local Singles Date Night** is the dating app that invests in your neighborhood. No subscriptions—users pre‑purchase **1, 3, 5, or 10** first‑date dinners from local partners, then commit to a **time window** and **experience type**; the app instantly reveals compatible singles who can meet **right then, right there**. When you “Ask” and they accept, your reservation locks, a voucher is issued, and chat opens—simple, safe, and real‑world. Restaurants win with **prepaid, reliable covers** and midweek demand smoothing; users win with curated experiences and fewer wasted swipes. We monetize via a **transparent 100% service fee** on top of fixed pricing, aligning our incentives with great matches and great nights out. *Meet local. Dine local. Date nights that strengthen your community.*

---

## **1\) Positioning & Core Value Proposition**

**Tagline:** *Meet local. Dine local. Date nights that invest in your neighborhood.*

**Differentiator:** No subscription fees. You prepay for a fixed **1, 3, 5, or 10‑dinner package** with partner restaurants. The platform matches you with compatible singles **only when you’ve committed to a time window and acceptable experience types**, then handles invitations and booking.

**Two‑sided value:**

* **Singles:** Curated first‑date experiences, fewer endless chats, more real-world meetings, budget clarity, and safety features built‑in.  
* **Restaurants/Businesses:** Predictable prepaid revenue, weeknight demand smoothing, simple onboarding, and co‑marketing reach.

---

## **2\) Target Segments & Rollout Strategy**

* **Diners:** 25–45 urban/suburban professionals; “experience‑first” daters tired of swipe fatigue; community-minded locals.  
* **Businesses:** Independent restaurants, wine bars, dessert cafés, mini‑golf/axe‑throwing/escape rooms, boutique cinemas.  
* **Launch City:** Start with a single metro (e.g., Santa Cruz–Monterey Bay or San Jose). Build a dense supply of packages and at least **500 registered singles** per micro‑region (city or zip cluster) before switching matching from waitlist to active.

---

## **3\) End‑to‑End User Journey (MVP)**

1. **Register & Profile**  
   * Location (ZIP \+ city), short bio (≤150 chars), **≤5 photos**, core preferences (age range, distance), interests, languages, credentials.  
   * Choose **local businesses you’d like to support** (favorites list).  
2. **Select Package**  
   * Buy **1, 3, 5, or 10 dinners** with visible **pre‑fix price** per venue and clear **100% service fee** on top (transparent value statement).  
   * Each package ties to **experience types** (e.g., “casual dinner,” “dessert \+ walk,” “activity \+ drink”).  
3. **Commit Window**  
   * Pick **time frame** (e.g., Thu 6–9pm, Fri 7–10pm) and acceptable experience types.  
4. **Candidate Reveal**  
   * System shows **compatible, available candidates** for that window/experience near you.  
   * You can “Ask” up to **N** people (throttled), who then receive an invite **for the selected location/time**.  
5. **Confirmation & Booking**  
   * If accepted, reservation locks, voucher generates (QR), and chat opens **only after booking** (to reduce pre‑date churn).  
6. **Post‑Date**  
   * Quick feedback prompts: vibe, safety, venue rating; re‑match offers; “pause” or “accelerate” toggle.

---

## **4\) Matching Model (Practical & Defensible)**

* **Availability-first:** Filter candidates by **overlapping time windows** and **experience types**.  
* **Geofenced proximity:** Radius by user setting (e.g., 10–25 miles).  
* **Two‑sided preferences:** Interests, languages, dietary tags; “deal‑breakers” (e.g., smoking).  
* **Fair exposure:** Capped “Ask” attempts per window; rotate ranking to prevent popularity bias.  
* **Explanations:** Show *why* someone is surfaced (“2 shared interests, both available Fri 7–9pm at Café Luna, 2.1 miles away”).

*Algorithmic approach:* Weighted score \= w₁(availability) \+ w₂(distance) \+ w₃(shared interests) \+ w₄(profile completeness) − w₅(recent declines). Use **stable‑match variant** with capacity constraints (restaurant seats per slot) so bookings are operationally feasible.

---

## **5\) Restaurant & Local Business Onboarding**

* **Partner Portal** (web): add pre‑fix menus, blackout dates, seating capacity by slot, voucher rules.  
* **Packages:** “First‑date prix fixe” (e.g., appetizer \+ 2 entrées \+ dessert), “shared plates,” “dessert & coffee,” “activity bundle.”  
* **Inventory control:** Vendors open **low‑demand slots** (Sun–Thu) to smooth utilization.  
* **Voucher mechanics:** Unique QR, “single‑use,” attach to reservation; POS note: “Local Singles Date Night – Prepaid.”

---

## **6\) Pricing, Fees & Unit Economics**

You specified: **100% service fee** on top of the venue’s pre‑fix price.

**Example:**

* Restaurant pre‑fix: **$50**  
* Service fee (100%): **$50**  
* **Customer pays:** $100

**Cash flow (per dinner):**

* You collect $100.  
* Pay restaurant $50 (less payment processor pass‑through if you remit net).  
* **Gross margin:** \~$50 − payment costs − ops.

**Payment costs (illustrative):** 2.9% \+ $0.30 per transaction (Stripe-like). On $100 ≈ $3.20. If you remit $50 to the venue via ACH (≈$0.25), net take ≈ **$46.55** before overhead.

**Sensitivity:** A 100% fee is **bold**. Some diners may balk. Consider **A/B tests**: 80%, 60%, or **tiered fee** (weekday slots \= lower fee; peak weekend \= higher), or **revenue‑share** with venues (e.g., 25–35%) where fee to diners caps at 50%. Keep your *take rate* aligned with perceived value (matching, safety, booking, guarantees).

**Packages (1/3/5/10):**

* **Volume incentive:** scale fee rebate or bonus credits (e.g., buy 5 dinners, **get 10% fee back** as “date credit” after first completed date).  
* **Breakage handling:** expiration windows (e.g., 6–12 months) with compliant disclosures (see compliance below).

---

## **7\) Policies (Trust, Safety, & Experience Quality)**

* **Identity & Safety:** ID verification (document \+ selfie), photo checks, device fingerprinting, **AI image moderation**; first chat opens **only after booking** to limit harassment. Panic button and “safe check‑in” prompts during date window.  
* **Ask limits:** Rate‑limit outbound “Ask”s (e.g., 3 per committed window); enforce **mutual-block**.  
* **No‑show & grace:** If a match cancels ≥24h, recredit the dinner; ≤24h use **1 free “oops”** per year, then partial fee loss.  
* **Refunds:** Clear rules: venue cancellation \= full recredit; user cancellation inside window \= partial recredit; weather emergencies \= rebook.

For enterprise-grade governance, align your moderation, incident response, and breach notifications with the same **InfoSec standards** you use in other PCG solutions (policy scaffolding, SOC monitoring, breach notification workflow).

## **8\) Technical Architecture (MVP that can scale)**

**Core services:**

* **Auth & Identity:** OIDC \+ KYC provider (document \+ selfie), device risk scoring.  
* **User Profile Service:** PII minimized; interests, preferences, photos; region & radius.

* **Analytics & Experimentation:** Event stream (sign‑ups, package purchases, asks, accepts, shows, rebooks), A/B infra.

**Data model (simplified):**

User(id, region, radius, prefs, interests\[\], languages\[\], photos\[\<=5\], bio\<=150, verified*bool)*  
*Package(id, user*id, size*enum{1,3,5,10}, purchased*at, expires*at, units*remaining)  
ExperienceType(id, name)  // dinner, dessert+walk, activity+drink…  
Venue(id, name, address, partner*status, categories\[\], prix*fix*price, payout*method)  
InventorySlot(id, venue*id, start*ts, end*ts, capacity, blackout*bool)  
Voucher(id, booking*id, code, status*enum{issued,redeemed,expired})  
Booking(id, userA*id, userB*id, venue*id, slot*id, status*enum{pending,confirmed,completed,canceled}, created*ts)  
Ask(id, sender*id, receiver*id, booking*window*id, experience*type*id, status*enum{sent,accepted,declined,expired})*  
*Payment(id, user*id, amount, method, fee*breakdown, package*id, status)

**Privacy & compliance:**

* Data minimization, encrypted PII/photos at rest; configurable retention (e.g., delete images after 24 months of inactivity).  
* **Gift card/advance payment** rules: handle **breakage**, refund, and expiry disclosures per state (e.g., California consumer protection and gift certificate laws). Consult counsel for city/state specifics; keep ledgers auditable.

---

## **9\) Restaurant Operations & SLAs**

* **Seat protection:** If a partner overbooks or cancels, they pay a **partner reliability fee** that funds customer recredits.  
* **Prep cues:** Auto‑send guest count, dietary flags, seating preferences 2h prior to slot.  
* **POS integration roadmap:** Start with QR \+ staff training, then move to POS APIs (Toast/Square) for automated redemption.

---

## **10\) Marketing Plan (Diner & Partner Growth)**

**Brand & identity:** Warm, neighborly; photography of real venues; color palette leaning local (sunset oranges, bay blues).

**Acquisition channels (Phase 1–2):**

* **Restaurant co‑marketing:** Table tents, bill stubs, QR flyers; “Date Night Partner” decals.  
* **Local media & PR:** “Dating that boosts small business” story; city blogs, radio.  
* **Community & events:** Launch nights with partner venues, singles mixers tied to package purchase.  
* **Referral loop:** “Bring a friend” \= $X fee credit when they buy a package and complete their first date.  
* **Content & email:** “First‑date scripts,” “Neighborhood highlights,” “New slots added.”  
* **Paid:** Hyperlocal social (radius targeting), Google Local Campaigns; budget tightly controlled with creative that foregrounds *supporting local*.

**Restaurant pipeline:**

* Target **20–30 venues** per district; offer **weekday demand smoothing** value and co‑marketing; highlight “prepaid, low‑no‑show” promise.

---

## **11\) KPIs, Economics & Experiments**

**North Stars:**

* **Completed first dates / active user / month**  
* **Restaurant partner NPS**  
* **GMV & Take Rate** (fee portion)

**Core metrics:**

* Sign‑up → package purchase conversion  
* “Ask” → accept rate  
* Show rate & no‑show rate  
* Slot utilization per venue  
* Refund/recredit rate  
* CAC vs. LTV (by package size)

**Baseline experiments:**

* 100% fee vs. 60–80% fee sensitivity.  
* Weeknight discount vs. weekend premium.  
* “Ask” cap (3 vs. 5\) impact on accept rate and perceived fairness.  
* Candidate explanation variants (2 vs. 4 reasons).

---

## **12\) Trust, Safety & Moderation Details**

* **Photo & bio policies:** no explicit content; auto‑blur detection; hate speech filters.  
* **Behavioral limits:** daily “Ask” cap, **cool‑off** on serial declines, report/ban tooling.  
* **Date safety:** check‑in prompts (“Arrived?”, “Safe?”), share location with a trusted contact; venue staff brief on escalations.  
* **Transparency:** clear privacy policy; unambiguous fee disclosure.

Again, align incident response and breach notification playbooks with your existing standards to reduce risk and audit friction.

---

## **14\) Feature Backlog (Selected User Stories)**

* **As a user,** I can buy a 3‑dinner package and see **units remaining** at all times; **AC:** ledger updates after redemption; voucher produces unique QR.  
* **As a user,** I only see candidates available **within my selected window and experience types**; **AC:** no candidates surfaced without time overlap.

---

## **15\) Example Product Copy & Email**

**Invite prompt (in‑app):**

*“You’re both available Fri 7–9pm and picked ‘casual dinner.’ Café Luna has a first‑date prix fixe 2.1 miles away. Invite Alex to meet there?”*

**Restaurant booking email:**

*Subject:* *Confirmed: Date Night at Café Luna – Friday 7:00 PM*\\ *Body:* “Your pre‑paid voucher (QR below) covers the First‑Date Prix Fixe. Arrive by 7:00 PM. If plans change, use the ‘Rebook’ link before 24h to keep your unit.”

---

## **16\) Risks & Mitigations**

* **Fee perception:** Pilot alternate fee levels; emphasize “local support \+ operational service value.”  
* **Supply density:** Don’t unlock matching until you hit a threshold of registered singles and venue slots per micro‑region.  
* **No‑shows:** Prepaid commitment \+ visible policies \+ one “grace” per user \+ venue reliability fees.  
* **Legal/compliance:** Treat packages like stored value/gift certificates; clarify terms, expiry, and recredit policy; ensure PCI, privacy, and data retention posture.

---

## **17\) What I’ll deliver next (once you pick a pilot city)**

* A concise **PRD v1** (features, non‑functionals, policies).  
* A **pitch deck** for restaurant partners and a **one‑pager** for local chambers of commerce.  
* An initial **market test plan** (creative, landing page, waitlist, email cadence).

---

### **One quick question to tailor this:**

**Which city or micro‑region do you want to pilot first (e.g., Santa Cruz/Aptos, San Jose, or another market)?**
